# Game flow: menus, cutscenes and Missions 1 and 2

The port follows the scenes named in the executable's RTTI. Only Easy and Normal are offered for now.

| Scene | Real game | Port |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CSceneBoot` | Saving-icon notice, needs OK | Not in |
| `CSceneOpening` | Warning, logos, opening movie, then the title. Left alone, the title goes back round after about 30 s | Opening movie, then the title |
| `CSceneStartMenu` | New Game, Load Game, Options | All three shown. New and Load both go to Mission Select. Options is locked |
| `CSceneMisSelect` | A row per difficulty, Bloody Palace, Demo Digest, Total Ranking, Gallery, Save, Load | Easy and Normal rows, mission 1 or 2. SQUARE toggles the Turbo tag |
| `CSceneMisStart` | Banner, Mission Start, Customize | Banner, Mission Start. Customize is locked |
| `CSceneGameMain` | The mission | The mission, see below |
| `CSceneResult` | Mission Clear with ranks and results | Mission Clear heading only, then back to Mission Select |

Things measured on the HD Collection that shaped this:

- Choosing Mission 1 plays the opening movie and the Mission 1 intro, 326 s in all, and they can't be skipped. Only then comes the briefing, with Customize highlighted. The port lets you skip.
- Mission 2 plays its own in-engine-looking movie, about 81 s, before Now Loading.
- The pause menu is Status, Save Data, Quit the Mission, Restart the Mission, Options, Exit. Restart goes back to the briefing on the real game. In the port it restarts straight away, without the movie. Status and Save Data are locked, and the debug toggles live under Options.

## Purpose-built for 16:9

The originals are 4:3. `tools/prepare_menu.py` recomposes each screen from its layers instead of stretching:

- **Title:** Vergil anchors left, Dante right, the logo stays centred, and the white and the band span the screen.
- **Mission Select:** the list stays at the left, and the background's lettering keeps its proportions while its plain part extends. The costume portrait is left out on request.
- **Banners:** zoomed to fill the width, losing some of the top and bottom.
- **Text:** an item's centre spreads out with the screen, but the item keeps its true shape.
- **Movies:** filled to the width and cropped top and bottom, as the HD Collection does.

The HUD (`psp/testroom/hud.c`) isn't the PS2 cockpit. It's a slim health bar and Devil Trigger segments in the corner, after Monster Hunter's. Weapon icons show for 2 s when switched, then fade. The style emblem still comes from the game's art.

## Assets

Everything comes off the player's disc when building:

| What | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Menu art and layout | GDATA slots, flat MODs with TIM2 sets. Some pair a MOD with the set before it, others after: title 2820, Mission Select 3183, banners 1506 (M1) and 1514 (M2) in English, strip 1673, Now Loading 2831, pause 2075, Mission Clear 1665 |
| Other menus, not used yet | Options 2091, language 2116, load/save 3528, costumes 3191-3223, styles from 1723 |
| Mission 1's stage | `st000`, slot 272, with its data in 273 |
| Mission 2's stage | `st001`, slot 276, with its data in 277 |
| Movies | MDATA1.AFS and MDATA2.AFS: MPEG-2 at 512x320, ADX sound, about 45 minutes and 2.2 GB |

Which movie is which, so far: MDATA2 0 the opening, 1 the Mission 1 intro, 2 Temen-ni-gru rising, 3 Lady. MDATA1 13 is taken to be the Mission 2 intro from its length and thumbnail. That one still needs checking by eye.

Movies are converted for the PSP's hardware JPEG decoder (`tools/prepare_movies.py`, `psp/testroom/movie.c`): 480x272 JPEG frames at 30 FPS with IMA ADPCM sound, about 200 to 330 KB/s. The three in use come to 114 MB. Conversion runs at install time, so it needs ffmpeg on the player's PC.

## Enemies in each mission

Measured on the HD Collection with Dante's health held up. Classes come from the executable's RTTI.

| Class | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `CEm000` | Hell Pride. Earlier notes called it the Sloth, which was wrong: Sloths come about midway through the game |
| `CEm002` | Seen in Missions 1 and 2. Not identified by name yet |
| `CEm004` | Seen in Mission 2. Not identified by name yet |
| `CEm008` | Hell Vanguard, Mission 2's boss, with a boss health bar |

- **Mission 1, Easy:** 3 Prides at the start. Later waves weren't measured, because Dante stood still.
- **Mission 1, Normal:** Prides, with `CEm002` from about 49 s.
- **Mission 2, Normal:** Prides and `CEm002`, `CEm004` from about 74 s, then with the street clear, the Hell Vanguard at about 138 s.
- **Mission 2, Easy:** 4 Prides were seen at the start in an earlier run. No census with fighting yet.

## What the missions do now, and what's a stand-in

Working: the stage, spawn points from the measurements above, waves, enemies dying, Mission Clear, and back to Mission Select.

Stand-ins and estimates:

- **All enemies are Prides.** `CEm002`, `CEm004` and the Hell Vanguard spawn points hold Prides. `CEm002` and `CEm004` have bodies in the same pack (slots [8] and [18] of GDATA 117) and AI tables already mapped (`docs/ENEMY_AI.md`), so they're the next step. The Vanguard is its own work.
- **Waves come when the last is dead.** That rule is a guess, as is how they're grouped. The game has event scripts for this (`EVT`, and `EVE` in the stage data), not read yet.
- **Easy gets the first 2 waves of each mission.** A guess.
- **Enemy health** is 6 light hits, chosen by eye. Their real health and Dante's real damage aren't read.
- **Dante can't die.** His health falls by the attack records' damage and stops at 1.
- **Doors and leaving the room** aren't in, so Mission 1 ends when its enemies do. The real mission goes on from there.
- **Sound** is only in movies. There's no music or effects in menus or the game.
- **No saves.**

## Next steps, in order

1. `CEm002` and `CEm004`: bodies and AI tables.
2. Read the mission event scripts for real waves, doors and triggers.
3. Enemy health and Dante's damage from the game, then dying and Game Over.
4. Result screen values and ranks.
5. Hell Vanguard.
6. Customize, Options, Load and Save.
7. Music and sound effects.

## Testing it

```
python tools/flow_test.py                 # the flow on the PSP, screenshots in analysis/testroom
python tools/flow_test.py --mission 2
python tools/autolink.py status           # the recovery plugin
```

In `CMP_SCRIPT.TXT`: `menu 1` runs the real flow, `movie n` plays n frames of each movie, `mkey button frame` and `gkey button frame` press buttons in menus and in game, `mshot frame` saves a menu picture, and `killevery n` kills everything every n frames.
